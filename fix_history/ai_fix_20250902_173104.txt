Here are the corrections made to the provided files `ai_code.py`:

### ai_code.py
```python
# Ultra-Breaker v2

def multiply_numbers(a, b):
    return a * b

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y  # Corrected to properly add two numbers

def subtract_numbers(a, b):
    if a <= b:
        raise ValueError("a must be bigger")  # Changed assertion to raise ValueError
    return a - b

def wrong_var_usage(): 
    not_defined_var = "Some value"  # Defined a variable to prevent NameError
    return not_defined_var

value = "this line is way too long"  # Reduced length to comply with PEP8
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed Infinite Loop:** Fixed `multiply_numbers` to function as intended.
2. **Fixed TypeError:** Corrected `add_numbers` to properly add two numbers.
3. **Handled AssertionError:** Changed assertion in `subtract_numbers` to raise a `ValueError` with a clearer message.
4. **Defined Missing Variable:** Provided a definition for the undefined variable in `wrong_var_usage`.
5. **Removed Duplicate Function:** Removed the second definition of `multiply_numbers`.
6. **PEP8 Compliance:** Shortened `value` to comply with line length recommendations.

With these corrections, the code should pass all tests and achieve a proper lint score. If you have further output or need additional fixes, please let me know!
